# Hospital_Stay_MultiClass_Classification

The Recent COVID-19 pandemic has raised alarms over one of the most overlooked areas to focus on: Healthcare Management. While healthcare management has various use cases for using data science, patient length of stay or LOS in short is one critical parameter to observe and predict if one wants to improve the efficiency of healthcare management in a hospital. 


This parameter helps hospitals to identify patients of high LOS risk (patients who will stay longer) at the time of admission. Once identified, patients with high LOS risk can have their treatment plan optimized to minimize LOS and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior knowledge of LOS can aid in logistics such as room and bed allocation planning.Ypose you have been hired as a Data Scieforist at HealthHabitat â€“ a not-for-profit organization dedicated to managing the functioning of Hospitals professionally and optimally.
The task is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on a case-by-case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better function
